            <p>The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway.<br><br> This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education. This curriculum itself is free and we tried to link to resources that are themselves free so anyone in the world can use them.</p>

            <p>FreeCodeCamp is a proven path to your first software developer job. More than 40,000 people have gotten developer jobs after completing this – including at big companies like Google and Microsoft. If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning and earn these certifications in order. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way. <br> <br> If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard. Practice the key. Practice, practice, practice. And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice. And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we also have thousands of hours of video courses on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. </p>
